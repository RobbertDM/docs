When a scan results in a failed check, the CLI output displays information about the check that failed and why. To offer more insight into the data that failed a check, Soda Cloud displays **failed rows samples** and, if connected to a Soda Agent, some **failed row summary and analysis** information in a check resultâ€™s history. Refer to [Analyze failed rows]({% link soda-cloud/failed-rows.md %}) for further detail.
