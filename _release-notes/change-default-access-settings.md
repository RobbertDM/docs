We're introducing the ability to change the default access settings for new datasets onboarded to Soda Cloud. So far Soda Cloud automatically assigned the _Everyone group_ as _Editor_. Starting today you can change the default role which is assigned or disable the feature.

Check the [Change the default access to datasets]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}#change-the-default-access-to-datasets) section in our docs to learn more about this feature.
